# Project 11: Code Generator (Compiler Backend)

**Objective**: Understand code generation and compilation

## Overview

Complete the compiler by adding code generation:
- Traverse parse trees to generate VM code
- Implement symbol table for classes and subroutines
- Handle variable scoping (class-level, subroutine-level)
- Generate code for expressions using stack-based evaluation
- Implement object construction and method calls
- Compile control flow structures
- Generate complete VM programs from high-level source

## Key Learning

Code generation, symbol tables, type checking, compilation

## Coming Soon

This project will be expanded with detailed learning paths, step-by-step instructions, code examples, and educational context similar to the Phase 1 projects.

# Project 7: Stack-Based Virtual Machine (Part 1)

**Objective**: Understand stack architecture and arithmetic operations

## Overview

Implement a VM translator for stack arithmetic:
- Translate VM commands to assembly language
- Implement push/pop for different memory segments (local, argument, this, that, constant, static, temp, pointer)
- Support arithmetic/logical operations: add, sub, neg, eq, gt, lt, and, or, not
- Handle memory segment mapping
- Test with increasingly complex stack programs

## Key Learning

Stack machines, memory segments, VM abstraction

## Coming Soon

This project will be expanded with detailed learning paths, step-by-step instructions, code examples, and educational context similar to the Phase 1 projects.

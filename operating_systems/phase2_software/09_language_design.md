# Project 9: High-Level Language Design

**Objective**: Design an object-oriented programming language

## Overview

Create a simple OOP language specification (Jack-like):
- Define syntax for classes, methods, fields, variables
- Support primitive types (int, boolean, char) and objects
- Include control structures: if/else, while, do
- Add expressions and operators
- Support arrays and strings
- Write sample programs: games, data structures, algorithms

## Key Learning

Language design, OOP concepts, syntax definition

## Coming Soon

This project will be expanded with detailed learning paths, step-by-step instructions, code examples, and educational context similar to the Phase 1 projects.

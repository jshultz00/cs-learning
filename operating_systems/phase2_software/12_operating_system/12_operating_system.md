# Project 12: Operating System Services

**Objective**: Understand OS abstractions and system software

## Overview

Implement a basic OS library in your high-level language:
- **Math**: Multiply, divide, sqrt (using only addition/subtraction)
- **String**: String objects, character arrays, type conversions
- **Array**: Dynamic array allocation
- **Memory**: Heap allocation (malloc/free with first-fit algorithm)
- **Screen**: Pixel manipulation, drawing primitives (line, circle, rectangle)
- **Keyboard**: Character input, line reading
- **Sys**: Halt, error handling, wait

## Key Learning

OS services, memory management, I/O, graphics algorithms

## Coming Soon

This project will be expanded with detailed learning paths, step-by-step instructions, code examples, and educational context similar to the Phase 1 projects.

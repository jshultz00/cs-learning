# Project 10: Syntax Analyzer (Compiler Frontend)

**Objective**: Understand parsing and syntax analysis

## Overview

Build a tokenizer and parser:
- Implement lexical analysis (tokenization)
- Create a recursive descent parser
- Build parse trees or XML output
- Handle all language constructs: classes, methods, statements, expressions
- Implement proper error handling and reporting
- Validate programs against grammar rules

## Key Learning

Lexical analysis, parsing, grammar, syntax trees

## Coming Soon

This project will be expanded with detailed learning paths, step-by-step instructions, code examples, and educational context similar to the Phase 1 projects.

# Project 8: Stack-Based Virtual Machine (Part 2)

**Objective**: Understand program flow and function calls

## Overview

Extend your VM translator with:
- Program flow commands: label, goto, if-goto
- Function commands: function, call, return
- Stack frame management
- Argument passing and local variable allocation
- Bootstrap code for system initialization
- Test with recursive programs (factorial, Fibonacci)

## Key Learning

Control flow, call stack, activation records, recursion

## Coming Soon

This project will be expanded with detailed learning paths, step-by-step instructions, code examples, and educational context similar to the Phase 1 projects.

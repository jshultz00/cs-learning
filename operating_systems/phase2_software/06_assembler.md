# Project 6: Two-Tier Assembler

**Objective**: Understand symbol resolution and code translation

## Overview

Build a full-featured assembler:
- Parse assembly language syntax
- Implement symbol table for labels and variables
- Handle A-instructions, C-instructions, and comments
- Perform two-pass assembly (symbol collection, code generation)
- Generate binary machine code
- Add helpful error messages and debugging output

## Key Learning

Parsing, symbol tables, two-pass algorithms

## Coming Soon

This project will be expanded with detailed learning paths, step-by-step instructions, code examples, and educational context similar to the Phase 1 projects.

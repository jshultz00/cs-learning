# Project 15: Full-Stack Application (Bonus)

**Objective**: Build a complete application using your entire stack

## Overview

Build a complete application using your entire stack:
- Write a game (Tetris, Snake, Pong) or utility program
- Use only your compiler, VM, and OS
- Optimize for performance
- Document the entire toolchain

## Coming Soon

This bonus project will be expanded with detailed learning paths, step-by-step instructions, and practical examples of complete applications.

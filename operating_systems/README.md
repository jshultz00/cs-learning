# Nand to Tetris: Learning Projects

A comprehensive guide to building a complete computer system from scratch, from logic gates to operating system.

## 🎯 Goal

Learn how operating systems and computers are built by **actually building one**. This project-based approach emphasizes understanding over completion—each project teaches fundamental concepts that power all modern computers.

## 📚 Project Structure

### Phase 1: Hardware Layer (Weeks 1-5)

Build a working computer from logic gates:

1. **[Logic Gate Simulator](phase1_hardware/01_logic_gates/01_logic_gates.md)** - Boolean logic and gate composition
2. **[Binary Arithmetic Calculator](phase1_hardware/02_binary_arithmetic/02_binary_arithmetic.md)** - ALU design and two's complement
3. **[Memory Hierarchy Simulator](phase1_hardware/03_memory_hierarchy/03_memory_hierarchy.md)** - Sequential logic and state
4. **[Assembly Language Emulator](phase1_hardware/04_assembly_emulator/04_assembly_emulator.md)** - Machine code and instruction sets
5. **[Complete Computer Architecture](phase1_hardware/05_computer_architecture/05_computer_architecture.md)** - Von Neumann architecture integration

**What you'll build**: A functioning 16-bit computer that executes programs!

### Phase 2: Software Layer (Weeks 6-14)

Build the software stack on top of your hardware:

6. **[Two-Tier Assembler](phase2_software/06_assembler/06_assembler.md)** - Symbol resolution and code translation
7. **[VM Part 1: Stack Arithmetic](phase2_software/07_vm_part1/07_vm_part1.md)** - Stack machines and memory segments
8. **[VM Part 2: Program Flow](phase2_software/08_vm_part2/08_vm_part2.md)** - Functions and recursion
9. **[High-Level Language Design](phase2_software/09_language_design/09_language_design.md)** - OOP language specification
10. **[Syntax Analyzer](phase2_software/10_parser/10_parser.md)** - Lexical analysis and parsing
11. **[Code Generator](phase2_software/11_code_generator/11_code_generator.md)** - Compilation and code generation
12. **[Operating System Services](phase2_software/12_operating_system/12_operating_system.md)** - System libraries and I/O

**What you'll build**: A complete toolchain from high-level language to machine code!
